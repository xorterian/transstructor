# transstructor
Construct your transstruction aka the carrier!

## Images

Making the AlgoPic.py ran in cmd in administrator mode you can give an x- and y-variable function using functions from LogFun imports, can set the width and height, and the programme will generate an 8-bit grayscale image.

## Sounds

Making the AlgoSnd.py ran you can give a t-variable function, set the length in ms - to be precise, the coefficient of the fs = 44100 ms -, and the programme will generate this sound.

## Videos

No code to generate videos yet.

## Further information

After generating a medium like a nice fractal image or a good bytebeat music, you can think of it as a carrier, a so-called "transstruction", a potential steganography which transports (carries) your hidden messages. These messages (payloads) should be in similar formatum to the carrier but with much lower bit-depth. If you transstruct a "good" carrier, the steganalytical softwares will be unable to detect the existence of the payload whose goodness is correlated with its so-to-say fractalness. Because the LSBs of the bitwise, tritwise or whatever fractals are so random that  it is hard to tell wether there is an encrypted payload or not. It is highly recemmonded not to replace the LSBs with your hidden message but to bitwise xor it in.
